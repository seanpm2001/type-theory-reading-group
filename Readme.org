* A Type Theory Study Group

The group will meet weekly, also during the summers, for a period of
one hour. Everyone has the responsibility to read the material before
arriving, but one person will have the responsibility of being in
solid command of it and presenting it as a discussion starter.

David is responsible for booking rooms and taking care of the
administrative work.
